# affection-simulation

### Simulation and visualization of affection social networks using igraph and plotly in Python.

Software that simulates affection social networks as those used in epidemiology and sociology. Also, it will be able
to generate visual graphs through plotly.

This software is made as an introduction to simulation of social phenomena.

## Installation
These modules require the following dependencies:
- igraph
- python-igraph
- numpy

After that is taken care of, you should be good to run the scripts. For now, only `people.py` and `network.py`
can be run, as they're the only modules with unit tests. When the project is completed, you'll be able to just
run `main.py` to use everything.
